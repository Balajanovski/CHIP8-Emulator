As can be seen the text sprites look like they've been slightly shifted to the left, yet, oddly the title screen remains untouched.

This sprite shifting behaviour is also shown in the gameplay. The wrong alien sprite is loaded as well as the spaceship being shifted slightly to the right, and overlapping from the left.
