# CHIP8-Emulator
A simple CHIP8 emulator created to learn more about emulation<br>
Modeled as close as possible to the Chip8 architecture, including using every single individual bit for the vga memory unlike other emulators which use a byte for each pixel.<br>
Criticism is appreciated.


## Remaining issues:
* Add sound
